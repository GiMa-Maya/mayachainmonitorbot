This bot is very cool.

Would be great if the monitoring bot could be customisable so you could get a feed of transactions based on preferences and thresholds.

I'm happy to throw you and Bigboss a bounty if you want to work together. Imagine the bot could spit out data from runestake.info

- asset gain / loss
- redeemable value
- LP Vs. HODL

and later even dynamically generated charts. the more you guys work together the more value delivered
