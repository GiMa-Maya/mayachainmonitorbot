1) Broadcast task for all

queue of messages -> forever loop with "anti-spam" delays

2) Track large RUne movements over Binance chain

3) ATH tracker

5) Announce new pools!

7) ToDo: integrate with runestake.info

Kai: This bot is very cool.

Would be great if the monitoring bot could be customisable so you could get a feed of transactions based on preferences and thresholds.

I'm happy to throw you and Bigboss a bounty if you want to work together. Imagine the bot could spit out data from runestake.info

- total gain / loss
- rune gain / loss
- asset gain / loss
- redeemable value
- LP Vs. HODL

and later even dynamically generated charts. the more you guys work together the more value delivered

8) Not sure. There are detailed amounts in the Treasury Reports each month (like https://medium.com/thorchain/monthly-treasury-report-september-74b13c27aa7f). Cant find any adresses this quick tho. Will have to dig deeper.

the address that adds the reserve is

bnb1axqc2gan462z6npw3c33srp4950mr5x28uc6wu

9) Add favorite BNB adresses - monitor in/out tx, pool performance ...

10) Use aiogram state machine

to manage Preferences and favorite addresses

12) price graph + deterministic price graph

use zrange to store timeseries

13) take mimir from thorchain http://IP:1317/thorchain/mimir bypassing Chaosnet
